# TopThreads plugin

This is a plugin for Freenet that ~~displays~~ *should eventually* display thread information about the most active threads.

# Status

First working draft / prototype. Don't expect any magic to happen, it will just display the 15 longest running threads (in terms of actual CPU running time).
